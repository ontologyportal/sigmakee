    "question" : "Which color can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths?",
    "answer" : "From what I understand, the answer should be unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations such as magenta, are absent, for example, because the colors can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths."

    "question" : "What are pure colors?",
    "answer" : "Probably, colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors."

    "question" : "Why optical window is also referred as the "visible window"?",
    "answer" : "From what I understand, the answer should be because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum."
