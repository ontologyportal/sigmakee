# About Vagrant

Vagrant allows easy access to virtualized servers on one's local development environment. See http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads to download Vagrant. Vagrant relies on a virtualizer, such as VMWare or VirtualBox. The current box is setup for use with VirtualBox. To install, see: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.

# Use

To start this Vagrant box, which upon first startup will build sigma and then start it.

```
mkdir ~/sigma_vagrant
cd ~/sigma_vagrant

cvs -d :ext:kyjohnsonipsoft@sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sigmakee checkout sigma
cvs -d :ext:kyjohnsonipsoft@sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sigmakee checkout KBs
mv sigma/build/vagrant/Vagrantfile ./
mv sigma/build/vagrant/bootstrap.sh ./

vagrant up
```

To restart the guest OS, rebuild and reinstall Sigma, and start Sigma, run `vagrant reload --provision`.

To start and stop Sigma manually, you may need to ssh into the vagrant box, thus.

```
<host>$ vagrant ssh
<guest>$ sigma stop
<guest>$ sigma start
