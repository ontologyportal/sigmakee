## jEdit Installation
It is highly recommended to build Ontologies with the SUMO plugin for jEdit. This plugin does text highlighting, syntax and type checking, and other features useful for building Ontologies. 
* [Install SUMO plugin for jEdit](https://github.com/ontologyportal/SUMOjEdit)

### jEdit Integration with Sigmakee (optional)
jEdit can additionally be integrated into Sigmakee, which will allow you to click on a source file and line number for a statement in the Sigma Browse page and be taken to the editor, open on that line.
