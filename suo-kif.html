<h2><a name="Scope">1 Scope</a></h2>

<p>Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a language designed for use in the
interchange of knowledge among disparate computer systems (created by different
programmers, at different times, in different languages, and so forth).

</p><p>KIF is not intended as an internal representation for
knowledge within computer systems or within closely related sets of
computer systems (though the language can be used for this purpose as well). 
Typically, when a computer system reads a  knowledge base in KIF, it converts
the data into its own internal form (specialized pointer structures, arrays,
etc.).  All computation is done using these internal forms.  When the computer
system needs to communicate with another computer system, it maps its internal
data structures into KIF.

</p><p>The following categorical features are essential to the design of KIF.

</p><ol>

<li>The language has declarative semantics.  It is possible to
understand the meaning of expressions in the language without appeal to an
interpreter for manipulating those expressions.  In this way, KIF differs from
other languages that are based on specific interpreters, such as Emycin
and Prolog.<p>

</p></li><li>The language is logically comprehensive -- at its most general, it provides
for the expression of arbitrary logical sentences. In this way, it differs from
relational database languages (like SQL) and logic programming languages
(like Prolog).<p>

</p></li><li>The language provides for the representation of knowledge about 
knowledge.  This allows the user to make knowledge representation decisions
explicit and permits the user to introduce new knowledge representation
constructs without changing the language.<p>

<h2><a name="Syntax">4 Syntax</a></h2>

<h4><a name="4.1">4.1 Introduction</a></h4>

As with many computer-oriented languages, the syntax of KIF is most easily
described in three layers.  First, there are the basic <i>characters</i> of the
language.  These characters can be combined to form <i>lexemes</i>.  Finally,
the lexemes of the language can be combined to form grammatically legal
<i>expressions</i>.  Although this layering is not strictly esential to the
specification of KIF, it simplifies the description of the syntax by dealing with
white space at the lexeme level and eliminating that detail from the expression
level.<p>

The notation
<tt><b>nonterminal*</b></tt> means zero or more occurrences;
<tt><b>nonterminal+</b></tt> means one or more occurrences;
The nonterminals <tt><b>space</b></tt>, <tt><b>tab</b></tt>,
<tt><b>return</b>,</tt> <tt><b>linefeed</b></tt>, and <tt><b>page</b></tt> refer
to the characters corresponding to ascii codes 32, 9, 13, 10, and 12,
respectively.  The nonterminal <tt><b>character</b></tt> denotes the set of all
128 ascii characters.  

</p><h4><a name="4.2">4.2 Characters</a></h4>

The alphabet of KIF consists of 7 bit blocks of data. In this document, we refer to
KIF data blocks via their usual ASCII encodings as characters (as given in ISO
646:1983).

<p>KIF characters are classified as upper case letters, lower case 
letters, digits, alpha characters (non-alphabetic characters that are used 
in the same way that letters are used), white space, and other characters 
(every ascii character that is not in one of the other categories).  
Initial characters which are the first character of a term, must be 
alphabetic.  Constants and variables consist of an initial alphabetic 
character plus a sequence of alphabetic, numeric or dash characters.</p><p> 

</p><pre>    upper ::= A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | 
              N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z

    lower ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | 
              n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z

    digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

    special ::= ! | $ | % | &amp; | * | + | - | . | / | &lt; | = | &gt; | ? |
              @ | _ | ~ |

    white ::= space | tab | return | linefeed | page

    initialchar ::= upper | lower

    wordchar ::= upper | lower | digit | - | _ | special

    character ::= upper | lower | digit | special | white
</pre>

Use of characters in "special" for word characters is discouraged as 
they may be given particular meaning in future versions of the standard or its extensions.

<h4><a name="4.3">4.3 Lexemes</a></h4>

The process of converting characters into lexemes in called <i>lexical
analysis</i>.  The input to this process is a stream of characters, and the
output is a stream of <i>lexemes</i>.<p>

The function of a lexical analyzer is cyclic.  It reads characters from the
input string until it encounters a character that cannot be combined with
previous characters to form a legal lexeme.  When this happens, it outputs
the lexeme corresponding to the previously read characters.  It then starts the
process over again with the new character.  Whitespace causes a break in the
lexical analysis process but otherwise is discarded.</p><p>

A <i>character string</i> is a series of characters enclosed in quotation
marks.  The escape character <tt>\</tt> is used to permit the inclusion of
quotation marks and the <tt>\</tt> character itself within such strings.</p><p>

</p><pre>   string ::= "character*"
</pre>

For the purpose of grammatical analysis, it is useful to subdivide the class of
words a little further, viz. as variables, operators, and constants.<p>

A <i>constant</i> is a letter or digit followed by any number of other legal word characters.</p><p>

</p><pre>    word ::= initialchar wordchar*
</pre>

A <i>variable</i> is a word in which the first character is <tt>?</tt> or <tt>@</tt>.
A variable with a '@' character is called "row variable" or "sequence variable".  It
holds a variable number of arguments.  While the unbounded implementation of this
makes KIF technically an "infinitary logic", with associated issues in efficient
implementation, a bounded interpretation does force KIF out of first order.  See Appendix
C for further information.

<pre>    variable ::= ?word | @word
</pre>

Semantically, there are four categories of constants in KIF -- object constants,
function constants, relation constants, and logical constants.  <i>Object
constants</i> are used to denote individual objects.  <i>Function constants</i>
denote functions on those objects.  <i>Relation constants</i> denote relations. 
<i>Logical constants</i> express conditions about the world and are either true
or false.  KIF is unusual among logical languages in that there is no syntactic
distinction among these four types of constants; any constant can be used where
any other constant can be used.  The differences between these categories of
constants is entirely semantic.<p>

</p><h4><a name="4.4">4.4 Expressions</a></h4>

The legal expressions of KIF are formed from lexemes according to the 
rules presented in this section.  Terms are used to denote objects in the 
world being described; sentences are used to express facts about the 
world.  Sentences can be used as terms, allowing higher-order expressions 
to be written.  A <i>knowledge base</i> is a finite set of sentences.<p> 

</p><pre>    number ::= [-] digit+ [. digit+] [exponent]
    exponent ::= e [-] digit+
</pre>

There are several types of terms in KIF -- variables, constants, character 
strings, and functional terms, as well as sentences themselves.<p> 
 
</p><pre>    term ::= variable | word | string | funterm | number | sentence
</pre>

<p>A <i>functional term</i> consists of a constant and an arbitrary
number of <i>argument</i> terms 
surrounded by matching parentheses.  Note that there is no syntactic 
restriction on the number of argument terms; arity restrictions in KIF are
treated semantically.</p><p>

</p><pre>    relword ::= initialchar wordchar*
    funword ::= initialchar wordchar*
</pre>

No "relword" and "funword" shall have the same character 
sequence in a particular knowledge base.

<pre>    funterm ::= (funword term+)
</pre>

The following BNF defines the set of legal sentences in KIF.  There
are six types of sentences.  We have already mentioned logical constants.<p>

</p><pre>     sentence ::= word | equation | relsent | logsent | quantsent
</pre>

An <i>equation</i> consists of the <tt>=</tt> operator and two terms.

<pre>    equation ::= (= term term)
</pre>

An <i>implicit relational sentence</i> consists of a constant and an arbitrary
number of <i>argument</i> terms. 
As with functional terms, there is no syntactic  restriction on the number of
argument terms in a relation sentence.<p>

</p><pre>    relsent ::= (relword term+)
</pre>

<p>The syntax of <i>logical sentences</i> depends on the logical operator 
involved.  A sentence involving the <tt>not</tt> operator is called a 
<i>negation</i>.  A sentence involving the <tt>and</tt> operator is called 
a <i>conjunction</i>, and the arguments are called <i>conjuncts</i>.  A 
sentence involving the <tt>or</tt> operator is called a 
<i>disjunction</i>, and the arguments are called <i>disjuncts</i>.  A 
sentence involving the <tt>=&gt;</tt> operator is called an 
<i>implication</i>; all of its arguments but the last are called 
<i>antecedents</i>; and the last argument is called the <i>consequent</i>.  
A sentence involving the <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> operator is called an 
<i>equivalence</i>.  

</p><pre>    logsent ::= (not sentence) |
                (and sentence+) |
                (or sentence+) |
                (=&gt; sentence sentence) |
                (&lt;=&gt; sentence sentence)
</pre>

There are two types of <i>quantified sentences</i> -- a <i>universally
quantified sentence</i> is signalled by the use of the <tt>forall</tt> operator, and
an <i>existentially quantified sentence</i> is signalled by the use of the <tt>
exists</tt> operator.  The first argument in each case is a list of variable
specifications.  A variable specification is either a variable or a list
consisting of a variable and a term denoting a relation that restricts the
domain of the specified variable.<p>

</p><pre>    quantsent ::= (forall (variable+) sentence) |
                  (exists (variable+) sentence)
</pre>

Note that, according to these rules, it is permissible to write sentences with
<i>free</i> variables, i.e. variables that do not occur within the scope of any
enclosing quantifiers.   The significance of the free variables in a sentence
depends on the use of the sentence.  When we assert the truth of a sentence with
free variables, we are, in effect, saying that the sentence is true for all values
of the free variables, i.e. the variables are universally quantified.  When we ask
whether a sentence with free variables is true, we are, in effect, asking whether
there are any values for the free variables for which the sentence is true, i.e.
the variables are existentially quantified.<p>

It is important to keep in
mind that a knowledge base is a <i>set</i> of sentences, not a <i>sequence</i>;
and, therefore, the order of forms within a knowledge base is unimportant. 
Order <i>may</i> have heuristic value to deductive programs by suggesting an order
in which to use those sentences; however, this implicit approach to knowledge
exchange lies outside of the definition of KIF.</p><p>

<h2><a name="Basics">5 Basics</a></h2>

<h4><a name="5.1">5.1 Introduction</a></h4>

The basis for the semantics of KIF is a <em>conceptualization</em> of
the world in terms of objects and relations among those objects.

<p>A <em>universe of discourse</em> is the set of all objects presumed or
hypothesized to exist in the world.  The notion of <em>object</em> used here is
quite broad.  Objects can be concrete (e.g. a specific carbon atom, Confucius,
the Sun) or abstract (e.g. the number 2, the set of all integers, the concept
of justice).  Objects can be primitive or composite (e.g. a circuit that
consists of many subcircuits).  Objects can even be fictional (e.g. a unicorn,
Sherlock Holmes).

</p><p>Different users of a declarative representation language, like KIF, are likely
to have different universes of discourse.  KIF is <i>conceptually
promiscuous</i> in that it does <i>not</i> require every user to share the same
universe of discourse.  On the other hand, KIF is <i>conceptually grounded</i>
in that every  universe of discourse <i>is</i> required to include certain
<i>basic</i> objects.

</p><p>The following basic objects must occur in every universe of discourse.

</p><ul>

<li> All numbers, real and complex.<p>

</p></li><li> All ASCII characters.<p>

</p></li><li> All finite strings of ASCII characters.<p>

</p></li><li> Words.  Yes, words are themselves objects in the universe of discourse,
along with the things they represent.<p>

</p></li><li> All finite lists of objects in the universe of discourse.<p>

</p></li></ul>

Remember, that to these basic elements, the user can add whatever
<i>non-basic</i> objects seem useful.

<p>In KIF, relationships among objects take the form of relations.  Formally, a
<i>relation</i> is defined as an arbitrary set of finite lists of objects (of
possibly varying lengths).  Each list is a selection of objects that jointly
satisfy the relation.  For example, the &lt; relation on numbers contains the
list &lt;2,3&gt;, indicating that 2 is less than 3.</p><p>

A <i>function</i> is a special kind of relation.  For every finite sequence of
objects (called the <i>arguments</i>), a function associates a unique
object (called the <i>value</i>).  More formally, a function is defined as a set
of finite lists of objects, one for each combination of possible arguments.  In
each list, the initial elements are the arguments, and the final element is the
value.  For example, the 1+ function contains the list &lt;2,3&gt;, indicating
that integer successor of 2 is 3.</p><p>

Note that both functions and relations are defined as sets of lists.  In fact,
every function is a relation.  However, not every relation is a function.  In a
function, there cannot be two lists that disagree on only the last element. 
This would be tantamount to the function having two values for one combination
of arguments.  By contrast, in a relation, there can be any number of lists
that agree on all but the last element.  For example, the list &lt;2,3&gt; is
a member of the 1+ function, and there is no other list of length 2 with 2
as its first argument, i.e. there is only one successor for 2.  By contrast, the
&lt; relation contains the lists &lt;2,3&gt;, &lt;2,4&gt;, &lt;2,5&gt;, and so
forth, indicating that 2 is less than 3, 4, 5, and so forth.</p><p>

Many mathematicians require that functions and relations have fixed arity, i.e
they require that all of the lists comprising a relation have the same length. 
The definitions here allow for relations with variable arity, i.e. it is
perfectly acceptable for a function or a relation to contain lists of different
lengths.  For example, the relation &lt; contains the lists &lt;2,3&gt; and
&lt;2,3,4&gt;, reflecting the fact that 2 is less than 3 and the fact that 2 is
less than 3 and 3 is less than 4.  This flexibility is not essential, but it is
extremely convenient and poses no significant theoretical problems.</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="5.3">5.3 Functional Terms</a></h4>

<p>The value of a functional term is
obtained by applying the function denoted by the function constant in the term
to the objects denoted by the arguments.

</p><p>For example, the value of the term <tt>(+ 2 3)</tt> is obtained by applying
the addition function (the function denoted by <tt>+</tt>) to the numbers
<tt><b>2</b></tt> and <tt><b>3</b></tt> (the objects denoted by the object
constants <tt>2</tt> and <tt>3</tt>) to obtain the value <tt><b>5</b></tt>,
which is the value of the object constant <tt>5</tt>.

</p><h4><a name="5.4">5.4 Relational Sentences</a></h4>

<p>A simple relational sentence is true
if and only if the relation denoted by the relation constant in the sentence
is true of the objects denoted by the arguments.  Equivalently, viewing a
relation as a set of tuples, we say that the relational sentence is true if
and only if the tuple of objects formed from the values of the arguments is a
member of the set of tuples denoted by the relation constant.

</p><h4><a name="5.5">5.5 Equations and Inequalities</a></h4>

<p>An equation is true if and only if the terms in the equation refer to the
same object in the universe of discourse.

</p><p>An inequality is true if and only if the terms in the equation refer to
distinct objects in the universe of discourse.

</p><h4><a name="5.6">5.6 True and False</a></h4>

<p>The truth value of <tt>true</tt> is true, and the truth value of
<tt>false</tt> is false.

</p><p></p><hr>

<h2><a name="Logic">6 Logic</a></h2>


<h4><a name="6.2">6.2 Logical Sentences</a></h4>

<p>A negation is true if and only if the negated sentence is false.

</p><p>A conjunction is true if and only if every conjunct is true.

</p><p>A disjunction is true if and only if at least one of the disjuncts is
true.

</p><p>If every antecedent in an implication is true, then the implication as a whole
is true if and only if the the consequent is true.  If any of the antecedents
is false, then the implication as a whole is true, regardless of the truth
value of the consequent.

</p><p>A reverse implication is just an implication with the consequent and
antecedents reversed.

</p><p>An equivalence is equivalent to the conjunction of an implication and a
reverse implication.

</p><h4><a name="6.3">6.3 Quantified Sentences</a></h4>

<p>A simple existentially quantified sentence (one in which the first argument is
a list of variables) is true if and only if the embedded sentence is true for
<i>some</i> value of the variables mentioned in the first argument.

</p><p>A simple universally quantified sentence (one in which the first argument is
a list of variables) is true if and only if the embedded sentence is true for
<i>every</i> value of the variables mentioned in the first argument.

</p><p>Note that the significance of free variables in quantifier-free sentences
depends on context.  Free variables in an assertion are assumed to be
universally quantified.  Free variables in a query are assumed to be
existentially quantified.  In other words, the meaning of free variables is
determined by the way in which KIF is used.  It cannot be unambiguously
defined within KIF itself.  To be certain of the usage in all contexts, use
explicit quantifiers.


</p><p></p><hr>

<h2><a name="Numbers">7 Numbers</a></h2>

<h4><a name="7.1">7.1 Introduction</a></h4>

<p>The referent of every numerical constant in KIF is assumed to be the number
for which that constant is the base <b>10</b> representation.  Among other
things, this means that we can infer inequality of all distinct numerical
constants, i.e. for every <tt><b>t1</b></tt> and distinct <tt><b>t2</b></tt> the
following sentence is true.

</p><pre>    (/= <b>t1</b> <b>t2</b>)
</pre>

<p>We use the intended meaning of numerical constants in defining the numerical
functions and relations in this chapter.  In particular, we require that these
functions and relations behave correctly on all numbers represented in this
way.

</p><p>Note that this does mean that it is incorrect to apply these functions
and relations to terms other than numbers.  For example, a nonnumerical term
may <i>refer</i> to a number, e.g. the term <tt>two</tt> may be defined to be
the same as the number <tt>2</tt> in which case it is perfectly proper to write
<tt>(+ two two)</tt>.

</p><p>The user may also want to extend these functions and relations to apply to
objects other than numbers, e.g. sets and lists.</p><p>

<h2><a name="Conformance">12 Conformance</a></h2>

<h4><a name="12.1">12.1 Introduction</a></h4>

<p>KIF is a highly expressive language.  For many, this is a desirable feature;
but there are disadvantages.  One disadvantage is that it complicates the job of
building fully conforming systems.  Another disdvantage is that the resulting
systems tend to be "heavyweight" (i.e. they are larger and in some cases less
efficient than systems that employ more restricted languages).

</p><p>In order to deal with these problems, the basic language specification 
is augmented with a set of "conformance dimensions".  These dimensions are 
not the same as the "conformance levels" of other languages.  Rather, each 
conformance dimension has a variety of levels within that dimension.  

</p><p>A "conformance profile" is a selection of alternatives from each conformance
dimension.  System builders are expected to make choices for each dimension and
and then ensure that their systems adhere to the resulting comformance profile. 
Systems are expected to use the terminology defined here to share information
about their conformance profile with other systems (in a protocol-specific
manner).

</p><p>Although this conformance profile scheme is more complex than one based
on  conformance levels, it accommodates varying capabilities and/or
computational constraints while providing a migration path from more restrictive
to more expressive.

</p><h4><a name="12.2">12.2 Conformance Dimensions</a></h4>

<h4>12.2.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>A <b>conformance dimension</b> is a classification of KIF sentences into
<b>conformance categories</b> on the basis of a single syntactic criterion.  (For
example, the quantification dimension provides two categories, quantified KIF
and unquantified KIF, based on whether or not a conforming knowledge base
contans quantifiers.)

</p><h4>12.2.2 Logical Form</h4>

<p>The first conformance dimension concerns logical form.  There are five basic
categories: atomic, conjunctive, positive, logical, and rule-like.  Rule-like
knowledge bases are further categorized as Horn or non-Horn and recursive or
non-recursive.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>atomic</b> if and only if it contains no logical
operators.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>conjunctive</b> if and only if it contains no logical
operators except for conjunction.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>positive</b> if and only if it contains no logical
operators except for conjunction and disjunction.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>logical</b> if and only if it contains no logical
operators except for conjunction, disjunction, and negation.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>rule-like</b> if and only if every sentence is either
atomic or an implication or reverse implication in which all subexpressions are
atomic sentences or negations of atomic sentences.  A rule system is a rule-like
knowledge base.

</p><p>A rule system is <b>Horn</b> if and only if every constituent of every
rule is atomic (i.e. no negations allowed).  Otherwise, the rule system is said
to be <b>non-Horn</b>.

</p><p>The dependency graph for a rule system is a graph whose nodes are
the constants in relational position.  There is an edge from the node for a given
relation constant <i>p</i> to the node of relation constant <i>q</i> if and only
if <i>p</i> appears in the body of a rule whose head predicate is <i>p</i>.

</p><p>A rule system is <b>recursive</b> if there is a cycle in its dependency
graph.  Otherwise, the rule system is said to be <b>non-recursive</b>.

</p><h4>12.2.3 Term Complexity</h4>

<p>The nature of terms defines a second conformance dimension.  There are two
categories: simple and complex.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>simple</b> if and only if the only terms occurring
the knowledge base are constants and variables.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>complex</b> if and only if it contains terms
other than constants or variables, e.g. functional terms or logical terms.

</p><h4>12.2.4 Order</h4>

<p>The third conformance dimension concerns the presence or absence of variables.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>ground</b>, or <b>zeroth-order</b>, if and only if it
contains no variables.  Otherwise, a knowledge base in <b>nonground</b>.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>first-order</b> if and only if there are no variables
in the first argument of any explicit functional term or explicit relational
sentence.

</p><p>A knowledge base is <b>higher-order</b> otherwise.

</p><h4>12.2.5 Quantification</h4>

<p>For nonground knowledge bases, there are two alternatives -- quantified
and unquantified.

</p><p>A nonground knowledge base is <b>quantified</b> if and only if it contains at
least one explicit quantifier.

</p><p>A nonground knowledge base is <b>unquantified</b> if and only if it contains
no explicit quantifiers.


</p><h4><a name="12.3">12.3 Common Conformance Profiles</a></h4>

<p>A <b>conformance profile</b> is a selection of alternatives for each
conformance dimension.  Given the dimensions and categories defined in the
preceding section, it is possible to define a large number of profiles.  A
single system may use different profiles in different types of communication. 
In particular, it is common to use one profile for assertions and another for
queries.  The following paragraphs define a few common types of systems with
their corresponding profiles.

</p><p>A <b>database system</b> is one in which (1) all assertions are atomic,
simple, ground, and baselevel and (2) all queries are positive, simple,
unquantified, and baselevel.

</p><p>A <b>Horn system</b> (e.g. pure Datalog) is one in which (1) all assertions
are rules that are Horn, unquantified, and baselevel and (2) all queries are
positive, non-recursive, unquantified, and baselevel.

</p><p>A <b>relational system</b> is one in which (1) all assertions are rules that
are simple, unquantified (but may be non-Horn and non-recursive), and baselevel
and (2) all queries are logical, non-recursive, unquantified, and baselevel.

</p><p>A <b>first-order system</b> is one that allows the broadest categories
within each conformance dimension except that only first-order expressions are
accommodated.

</p><p>A <b>full KIF system</b> is one that accepts the broadest categories within
each conformance dimension, i.e. any KIF knowledge base is acceptable in any
context.

</p><h4><a name="12.4">12.4 Dealing with Differences in Conformance Profiles</a></h4>

<p>The existence of multiple conformance profiles raises the question of what
happens when systems with different profles must communicate.

</p><p>Whenever the conformance profile of a receiver is known, a sender should avoid
sending expressions that fall outside the receiver's conformance profile.

</p><p>Unfortunately, this rule cannot be enforced in all situations.  In some cases,
conformance information about receivers is unavailable; and, even when
conformance information is available, it may be desirable to send a message that
falls outside a receiver's profile, e.g. it may be most efficient for a sender
to broadcast a single knowledge base to a large number of receivers with differing
conformance profiles rather than sending different knowledge bases to each
receiver.

</p><p>Whenever a receiver receives a non-conforming expression, it is free to ignore
the expression, even though it may be able to make sense of portions of that
expression.  If the receiver ignores a non-conforming expression and the sender
requests a reply, the receiver should report a failure.

<b>Row Variables</b><p>
One option is to treat row varaibles as "macros", which would get expanded automatically so 

</p><pre>(=&gt;
   (and
      (subrelation ?REL1 ?REL2)
      (holds ?REL1 @ROW))
   (holds ?REL2 @ROW))
</pre>

would become

<pre>(=&gt;
   (and
      (subrelation ?REL1 ?REL2)
      (holds ?REL1 ?ARG1))
   (holds ?REL2 ?ARG1))

(=&gt;
   (and
      (subrelation ?REL1 ?REL2)
      (holds ?REL1 ?ARG1 ?ARG2))
   (holds ?REL2 ?ARG1 ?ARG2))
</pre>
etc. <p>

Note that this "macro" style expansion has the problem that unlike
the true semantics of row variables, that it is not infinite.  If the interpretation
only expands to five variables, that there is a problem if the 
knowledge engineer uses a relation with six.
